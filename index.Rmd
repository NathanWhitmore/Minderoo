### Objective
<div class = "blue">
The purpose of this website is to provide brief, practical advice to people wanting to better integrate data science into their conservation and development projects. 
</div>

<br>

In order to help individuals and organisations associated with the Minderoo Foundation achieve that goal I am assembling a set of support materials to cover the major concepts.

### Support materials
* [Slides](slides.html)
* [How to build a basic strategy](strategy.html)
* [Science - the basics](science.html)
* [Additional resources](resources.html)

### About the author
My name is Nathan Whitmore, and I’m a conservation scientist and practitioner. Over the years I have worked variously as a fisheries observer, conservation ranger, and, from 2012 to 2018, as an in-country adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Papua New Guinea programme. I am currently based in New Zealand where I work for [Reproducible](reproducible.co.nz) as a conservation analyst.
